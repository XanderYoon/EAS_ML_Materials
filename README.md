# Machine Learning Techniques with TensorFlow: CNN, LSTM, and CNN+LSTM

Welcome to the repository! This project is designed to provide students in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS) with hands-on examples of how to implement different machine learning techniques using TensorFlow. The repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and a combined CNN+LSTM model. These notebooks are intended to serve as a practical guide for understanding the coding and application of these models in Python.

## Overview

This repository contains the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. **CNN Example**: 
   - This notebook introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and demonstrates their application in image data processing. CNNs are particularly well-suited for spatial data, making them a powerful tool for tasks such as image classification and feature extraction.
   - The notebook walks through the process of building a CNN model using TensorFlow, training it on a dataset, and evaluating its performance.

2. **LSTM Example**:
   - This notebook focuses on Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly effective for sequential data. LSTMs are widely used in time series analysis, speech recognition, and other tasks where the order of data points is crucial.
   - The notebook includes a step-by-step guide on constructing an LSTM model, training it on sequential data, and analyzing its predictions.

3. **CNN+LSTM Example**:
   - This notebook combines the strengths of both CNNs and LSTMs by creating a hybrid model. CNNs are used to extract features from spatial data, which are then fed into an LSTM network to capture temporal patterns. This approach is ideal for tasks such as video analysis or any application involving spatiotemporal data.
   - The notebook covers the integration of CNN and LSTM layers within a single model, along with training and evaluation techniques.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this repository are to:

- **Educate EAS Students**: Provide clear, concise examples of how to implement CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN+LSTM models using TensorFlow.
- **Enhance Practical Skills**: Offer hands-on coding experience, allowing students to experiment with and adapt the models to different datasets and problems.
- **Facilitate Understanding**: Break down complex machine learning concepts into digestible steps, making it easier for students to grasp both the theoretical and practical aspects of these techniques.
